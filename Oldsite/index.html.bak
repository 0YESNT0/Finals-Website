                    <p>Media Literacy is the ability of a person to distinguish different forms of media, identify its roles in culture,
					and think critically about the information obtained and the message of it. 
					While Information Literacy is one’s capability to assess, understand, make use of, and 
					distinguish if the information is reliable or not, which can help in problem solving situations, 
					decision making, and the acquisition of knowledge. Technology literacy is one’s capability to use technology to assess, 
					create and communicate information. These forms of literacy are connected to one another since you get information from the media, 
					and you use technology in order to create media. These can affect society by giving free and easy access to information to everyone. 
					This however can cause implications too as it is also easy to create fake information, giving confusion, and discourse among the masses. 
					But if done properly, everyone can reliably obtain proper information if they are capable of assessing what information 
					they get instead of taking it at face value.</p>

                                We encounter media frequently in our lives, but what exactly is media? What should we be aware about it?
                            </p>

                        Media is a way of spreading information, be it digitally, physically (with the use of paper), or via audio (using radio and the like); it can affect people positively or negatively which can depend on the information they receive. I see it as a valuable source for current news but it may not be fully trust worthy so I take information that I get from common media with some doubts until I do more research about the topic.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb-3 indent">
                        Media technologies have the power to transform culture since it spreads not only information, but ideological messages or propaganda. And with our current use of media, it is also possible to be influenced by the culture of others from interacting with them through the internet mainly with twitter and the like. With the connections created from this according to Galarneau, L. (2017), things such as Support, Creativity, Diversity and many more can be some of the things that help transform the culture of the people, which can also shape culture. Although, social media can have negative effects to one’s development of culture as it is common for harassment and cyber bullying to occur.
                    </p>
					<p class="pb-3 indent">
                        Media also has large impact in politics as due to the interaction in social media, they can be influenced by other’s culture and beliefs, changing their views about politics and can sometimes be manipulated in some form to cause discourse among the people. An example of this is with the occurrence of radicalized jihadist youth due to the use of media to convert their ideals, according to Furedi, F.(2017).

					<p class="indent">
						There are multiple ways one can obtain information, the most common one is the internet through the use of Search engines, another is through going to a library and find books that relate to the information you need although it may take a longer time compared to using search engines, but the information is more reliable. Another one is by using Google Scholar, which can show academic researches which can be reliable and a good source of information. According to Emerald Publishing (n.d), there are four components to ones searching skills, knowing where to find the information, knowing what information is needed, knowing how to find the sources of it, and recoding one’s research. By having competency in these components, one can be more effective and reliable in searching for information.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						In order to choose a proper source, one should be able to identify if the information is reliable or credible. According to Science Buddies (n.d.) good information comes from a credible source, not too old, not biased, free of errors, properly cites the source of the information and is easy for people to obtain. But when using the internet, its not easy to identify if the source is credible. According to a page by Notre Dame de Namur University(NDNU),  Website Domains with “.edu”, “.gov”, or “.org” have more legitimacy than ones with “.com” in their link.

					<p class="indent">
						As a student, manipulative information and media can affect us with how we receive correct information, as it is common for students to do research or get reference materials for the subjects, there can be sources that manipulate it to give false information, or incomplete and biased information. It can also shape our beliefs if we encounter manipulated information too frequently.													
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						Multimedia information can be a great help to those who want to learn something as certain people learn better through listening, or reading, seeing or by doing, this in turn gives them options on how they want to learn specific skills. Thus improving their skill set for the future.
					</p>
					<p class="indent">
						In order to evaluate the reliability and validity of multimedia information, we should always check for the source, then see if they used scientific or other reliable information sources as reference, next, try to compare the information with other similar topics or sources, so that you can identify inconsistencies, or lack of explanations of the information.
					</p>
					<hr>					
					<br>
					<h2 class="InformationBG" >Final Note</h2>
					<p>
						Remember to consume media responsibly, with the current situation and the amount of chaos thats happening, dont force your self to take it all in, and dont forget to enjoy your self with some M E M E S.
